# Bliss: Music Event Search App

## Project Description

My app is titled "Bliss" -- it is a music event search application using ReactJS and powered by utilizing Songkick's API database. This app is intended for users who are constantly 'on-the-go' and need to quixkly search for events near them; no login or sign-up required to access the app. Users can search for music events, festivals, and concerts by Artist Name and by City or nearest Metro Area.
