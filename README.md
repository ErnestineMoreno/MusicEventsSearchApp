# Bliss: Music Event Search App

## Project Description

My app is titled "Bliss" -- it is a music event search application using ReactJS and utilizing Songkick's API database. This app is intended for users who are constantly 'on-the-go' and need to quickly search for virtual live events online and/or in the area; no login or sign-up required to access the app. Users can search by Artist Name and by City or nearest Metro Area.
