## Project Description

My app is called "Bliss". It's a music events app for people who are looking to attend upcoming festivals/concerts. Users can search for upcoming events by artist name or location. In the future, I will add features that will allow users to listen to snippets of the artist's songs and include a mini bio for that particular artist and/or band.

### MVP User Stories

MVP User Stories

As a user, I want to be able to search for a particular artist or band and see a listing of all upcoming music events (festivals/concerts/shows) playing by location and artist name.

As a user, I would like to filter upcoming event dates as I scroll through the search results.
